#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Answer: 
Software engineering involves the methodical use of engineering principles, techniques, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems. It is vital to the technology sector, facilitating the creation of software applications and systems that drive many facets of contemporary life, such as communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare. It plays a great role in the Technology Industry.



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Answer:
1. The development of programming languages: The development of programming languages transformed software engineering by moving from machine code to more abstract, readable forms. High-level languages boosted productivity, while object-oriented and functional paradigms offered new ways to structure code. Modern languages continue to evolve, enhancing software quality and addressing diverse needs.
   
2. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s: The advent of structured programming in the 1970s was a milestone in software engineering, fundamentally reshaping how software was developed. It improved readability, making programs easier to understand, debug and maintain.

3. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s: This marked a major shift in software engineering by prioritizing flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development over rigid processes. This allows teams to respond quickly to changing requirements and deliver high-quality software more efficiently.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Answer:
1. Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.

2. Design: Creating detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.

3. Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.

4. Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.

5. Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.

6. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Answer:
Waterfall is a structured, linear approach suited to projects with clear requirements and minimal changes, focusing on detailed upfront planning and sequential development while Agile is a flexible, iterative approach that embraces change and continuous feedback, emphasizing collaboration, adaptive planning, and incremental delivery.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Answer:
Software Developer: He is in charge of coding and putting solutions into action.

Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by creating and carrying out test plans.

Project Manager: Manages the planning, execution, and completion of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Answer:
They improve productivity, collaboration, and code quality by equipping developers with features like code editors, version control, debugging tools, and automated testing.
Examples of IDEs are Visual Studio and IntelliJ IDEA.
Examples of VCS are Git and Subversion.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Answer:
1. Changing Requirements
2. Tight Deadlines
3. Technical Debt

Strategies to Overcome the challenges:
1. Effective communication
2. Agile methodologies
3. Prioritization of tasks
4. Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Answer:
1. Unit Testing: Testing the separate parts or modules of the software.
2. Integration Testing: Testing how different components or subsystems interact with each other.
3. System Testing: Testing the complete software system in its entirety.
4. Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Answer:
Prompt engineering involves crafting effective and precise inputs for language models or AI systems to generate desired outputs. It focuses on designing queries or instructions that guide the AI to produce accurate and relevant responses. Prompt Engineering is important in interacting with AI models because it helps in making your question clear and direct so the AI can understand your request and produce an accurate answer.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Answer:
vague prompt: "Tell me about BMW".

Improved Prompt: "Give me a summary of BMWâ€™s electric cars for 2024, including the main models and what they offer".

The improved prompt is better because it specifies the Topic, and gives a timeframe which would guide the AI to deliver a relevant response.
